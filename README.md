Tyle
====

## What is it?

The Tyle Editor is a simple texture based tiled map editor being developed to aid the production of Waifu Quest. Mostly for fun. It is still very much WIP. Here you will find the goals and roadmap for Tyle.

Tyle was built around Waifu Quest: https://github.com/Honeybunch/WaifuQuest and has since branched so that you don't need to clone Waifu Quest to use Tyle.
